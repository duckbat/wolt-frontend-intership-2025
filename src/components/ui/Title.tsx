import React from "react";

const Title: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-xl mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="font-bold mb-2">Wolt Calculator</h1>
      <h2 className="text-lg break-words">
        Some text later. This is my Solution for that. If there's more text, this component will expand vertically and push other components down.

    </div>
