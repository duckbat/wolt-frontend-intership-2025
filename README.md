# Wolt 2025 Frontend Engineering Internship Assignment

## About the Project ðŸ’»

This project is a solution for the **Wolt 2025 Frontend Engineering Internship [Assignment](https://github.com/woltapp/frontend-internship-2025/tree/main)**. It implements a **Delivery Order Price Calculator** that calculates delivery fees, surcharges, and total prices based on user input and [Static](https://consumer-api.development.dev.woltapi.com/home-assignment-api/v1/venues/home-assignment-venue-helsinki/static) and [Dynamic](https://consumer-api.development.dev.woltapi.com/home-assignment-api/v1/venues/home-assignment-venue-helsinki/dynamic) API data.


The application was built using mainly **Vite** + **React** and **TypeScript**

Continuous Integration is enabled by **Github Actions**.
Location (latitude and long to latitude and longitude) calculations are calculated with **Harvesine formula**.

## Features âœ¨

- **Dynamic Delivery Price Calculation**: Calculates prices based on venue, user location, and cart value.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures all fields are valid with error messages for invalid input.
- **API Integration**: Fetches venue data dynamically from the provided [Static](https://consumer-api.development.dev.woltapi.com/home-assignment-api/v1/venues/home-assignment-venue-helsinki/static) and [Dynamic](https://consumer-api.development.dev.woltapi.com/home-assignment-api/v1/venues/home-assignment-venue-helsinki/dynamic) API data.
- **Responsive Design**: Built for having a good responsiveness on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Testing & Coverage**: Includes unit tests and code coverage using **Vitest**, **React Testing Library** and **CodeCov** to visualize coverages.
- **Accessibility**: Ensures accessible interactions for a wide range of users like **VoiceOver** and **Tab control**.

## Might be interesting ðŸ‘€
### Interesting Problems faced and implemented solutions for them
1. *Optimizing API Calls*
- **Problem**: Venue slug form was constantly fetched after writing an input, resulting in uncessary fetching.
- **Solution**: Added useEffect with debounceTimeout to stop fetching after 2.5 second of input. Reduced unnecessary API calls.

2. *Improving Accessibility*
- **Problem**: Accessibility test showed that once person moves our from the input using Tab, it doesnt trigger API fetch.
- **Solution**: Created onBlur function that fetches additional API once user loses focus on the input form

3. *Input Design*
- **Problem**: Wanted to create animated placeholder for Venue Input
- **Solution**: Solved with adding additional label instead of placeholderwith focus transition in TailwindCSS
